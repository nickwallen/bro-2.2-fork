This contains support for Napatech adaptors using the Napatech 3GD drivers.

To build Bro with Napatech adaptor support enabled do the following:

./configure --with-napatech=/opt/napatech3/
make
make install

You may replace /opt/napatech3/ with the location where you've installed the
Napatech drivers.

Other configuration options may be added to the configure line as well.

Bro uses the Napatech NTPL to configure traffic balancing of packets across
Napatech streams as follows.

Currently Bro only support Unix style timestamps and the NT Packet Descriptor,
the other types (Ext7, Ext8, etc..) have not been tested and results will be
unpredictable at best.

Create a file similar to bro.ntpl below to set the adaptor's load balancing
options similar to the following.

brobox:~$ cat bro.ntpl
HashMode[Priority = 0; Layer4Type = UDP, TCP, SCTP] = Hash5TupleSorted
HashMode[Priority = 1; Layer3Type = IPV4] = Hash2TupleSorted
Assign[StreamId=(0..3)] = All

Prior to invoking Bro, install the NTPL configuration as follows.

brobox:~$ /opt/napatech3/bin/ntpl -f bro.ntpl

Modify your node.cfg file to match the load balancing performed by the Napatech
adaptor as directed by the NTPL configuration show above.

The following example node.cfg file attaches the four Napatech streams created
above to four bro workers.

You'll need to modify the example 10.1.1.10 IP address used below for your own
environment.

# Example BroControl node configuration.
#
# This example has a standalone node ready to go except for possibly changing
# the sniffing interface.

# This is a complete standalone configuration.  Most likely you will
# only need to change the interface.
#[bro]
#type=standalone
#host=localhost
#interface=nt0

## Below is an example clustered configuration. If you use this,
## remove the [bro] node above.

[manager]
type=manager
host=10.1.1.10
#
[proxy-1]
type=proxy
host=10.1.1.10
#
[worker-1]
type=worker
host=10.1.1.10
interface=nt0
#
[worker-2]
type=worker
host=10.1.1.10
interface=nt1
#
[worker-3]
type=worker
host=10.1.1.10
interface=nt2
#
[worker-4]
type=worker
host=10.1.1.10
interface=nt3

Interfaces nt0, nt1, nt2 and nt3 correspond to the four Napatech streams
created by the Napatech NTPL.

The configuration above can be a managed with broctl as follows:

broctl install
broctl start

You may modify bro.ntpl and node.cfg for alternative load balancing options
for fewer or more workers.
